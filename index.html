                Hi hi! I'm a 1st year computer science student at UCSC, although I plan on graduating earlier maybe around the '27 to '28 range.<br>
                I'd like to think I enjoy computer science, I've always enjoyed studying either that or math in my free time. Recently I've been trying<br>
                To get ahead on a bunch of prereqs I need. Actually as I write this I realize I need to work on a real project lol. <br>
                But as real projects go things in C or in machine learning area have been really exciting to learn about, so I'll probably choose that to be the next project. <br>
                Have fun scrolling through my page I guess :3<br>
