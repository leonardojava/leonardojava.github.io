            Hi hi everyone!
            Uhhh this was supposed to be a christmas card, that I released on Christmas(duh), but if I did that I would've had to talk to my family while I was physically there about it, so I decided to wait until I was back in California.
            To be honest I'm not really one to celebrate "days" outside of using them as an excuse to eat, but this is probably going to be my first year on my own ish. So I thought it'd be nice to send out a little "letter" to let everyone know whats up.
            I don't actually know what I'm supposed to put here either so I'll just start listing stuff I did in 2025: <br>
            <br>
            Some cool stuff I worked on / achieved: <br>
            -Built a feedforward Neural Network from scratch <br>
            -Solved ~250 leetcode bringing my total to 510 now !!! <br>
            -Taught the professor in charge of a research lab at UCSC how to give dap <br>
            -Almost got my Associates degree as a highschooler <- apparently I needed an extra diversity credit haha <br>
            -Redid my personal site(it's here) <br>
            -Learned a lot of C, and math stuff ....
            <br>
            <br>
            Cool things I watched/red/listened to: <br>
            -Julia Wolf, top 3 songs by her are In My Room, Jennifers Body, and uhh Kill You Off <br>
            -The Chainsaw Man Movie: Reze arc is one of the best things I've ever laid my eyes upon, 100% worth missing the birth of your first born <br>
            -Apothecary Diaries, its shooo good <br>
            -Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, I rewatched it this year its shooo goodddd <br>
            -Tatsuki Fujimoto's Look Back, anything Tatsuki Fujimo makes is shooo goodddd I read the one shot a while ago, but watched the movie recently also peak <br>
            -Love Bullet, it's just tuff <br>
            -I Want To Eat Your Pancreas, I was reading this at a chinese resturant and was losing it I need to watch it <br>
            -Lucky Star, another rewatch its so peak I'm literally Konata <br>
            -The Climber, beautiful story and art I must become a climber too <br>
            -Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications 6th Edition by Kenneth H. Rosen, a really fun read no calculus needed discrete math is tuff <br>
            <br>
            anyways I lost the plot a little, but I hope everyone that read this has a lot to look forward for 2026! We are ALL locked in.

            <br>
            Without loss of generality, <br>
            Leo <br>
