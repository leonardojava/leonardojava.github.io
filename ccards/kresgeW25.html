            Hi hi everyone! I kind of assumed that writing Christmas cards was always some white people shit,
            so I thought it'd be funny to make some personalized ones for people in my life.
            I probably wouldn't consider you guys that important after meeting you guys like 3ish months ago, but I'm grateful I did! 
            To be honest, I was scared that when I came here I'd be locked up in my room just studying 24/7 losing my fucking mind.
            I kind of lucked out though! You guys have been really nice, and my first quarter/year here at Santa Cruz would be a lot worse without yall.
            Hopefully everyone here has a good winter break! And a happy holiday season type shit!!! Also there's like 8 diff floor 4 group chats I'm just sending it to Autism Core, this is meant for everyone on floor 4 tho including LoganLojo :333<br>
            <br>
            With Respect To, <br>
            Leo <br>
