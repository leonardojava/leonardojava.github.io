            Hi hi Debby! I think it's been a while since we've talked. I've just finished my first quarter at UC Santa Cruz! And it's been really fun. 
            I've been able to meet a bunch of new people, and learn a bunch of new things! I think my only complaint is that I'm not sure if I'll be able to take as much math as I want to, at least as just pure CS.
            I even sat in some of the Calculus lectures here, and got some nostalgia from your class lol. I can't tell if this one professor here was just mean, but he was having students prove limits using delta-epsilon. 
            There was straight up another professor who assigned coding assignments for his calculus class it was actually really messed up. But I'm also really excited for the future! I know next quarter I'm supposed to
            take discrete math, and have even studied a little on my own. I kind of wish EVCC offered it especially with the # of CS/CE majors :/ , but oh well. Anyways I hope you're doing a bunch of fun stuff too!!!
            Have a happy holidays Debby!!!!<br>
            <br>
 
            Always your student, <br>
            Leo <br>
